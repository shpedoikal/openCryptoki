Miscellaneous tests

Object Management testing

obj_mgmt_tests
obj_mgmt.c - This testsuite performs various object management tasks.
The do_CreateTokenObjects() and do_HWFeatureSearch() functions
create token objects and by default or skipped.
To include these two functions, use the "-noskip" option when issuing the tests.

Spinlock testing

obj_mgmt_lock_tests
spinlock_tests.sh
spinlock_child.sh
These test two spinlocks:
	- /var/lock/LCK..opencryptoki which is used when accessing shared
	  memory via pkcsslotd and pkcs#11 api calls.
	- /var/lock/LOCK..opencryptoki_stdll which is used when accessing
	  global shared memory in the STDLLs.

The file, spinlock_tests.sh is a bash script that creates a
number of child processes. Each child process runs spinlock_child.sh script.

Usage: spinlock_tests.sh -p <num> -l <count> -s <slotid>
	p: the amount of child processes to create
	l: the number of times each child process executes obj_mgmt_lock_tests
	s: the slot to test

The file, spinlock_child.sh is a bash script that executes
obj_mgmt_lock_tests a number of times. It, along with any arguments is called
from spinlock_tests.sh script. However, it can also be run independently.

Usage: spinlock_child.sh -l <count> -s <slotid>
	l: the number of times each child process executes obj_mgmt_lock_tests
	s: the slot to test

So each child process created in spinlock_tests.sh will run
obj_mgmt_lock_tests a number of times to test the spinlocks.

obj_mgmt_lock_tests was derived from obj_mgmt.c.
It contains several api calls that will want to acquire the various
spinlocks.

Usage: obj_mgmt_lock_tests -slot <slotid>
